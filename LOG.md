# Day 1 of development
Day 1 was just really setting up the terminal for development, like switching it from canocial mode to raw mode and understanding how the terminal worked, how the termion library worked etc.

# Day 2 of development
On Day 2 I got the cursor to show up on the screen and allowed the user to move the cursor around the screen. Afterwards I setup the welcome window of the text editor and started to work on viewing and opening files. Day 2 was also the day I refactored my code for the first time! yayay :) I also setup the github repo for cell and pushed my work onto there too

# Day 3 of development
On Day 3 I finished the file viewer. The user was now able to scroll and view the whole file properly. I also setup the status and message bar. Finally I then started to work on the text editing aspect of cell

# Day 4 of development
On Day 4 I finally was able to turn cell from a text viewer into a proper text editor. The user could now view and edit the text file and also save it. Users could also make new files and save them. I also setup clippy and refactored my code. I also added a bunch of performance related improvements
